# GitHub Repository Update Status Report

**Project Name:** 3D Coal Mine Transportation Visualization

**Date:** September 17, 2023 10:09 AM

## Overview

This status report provides an update on the progress of updating our GitHub repository for the "3D Coal Mine Transportation Visualization" project. The purpose of this update is to ensure that the repository contains up-to-date README files and essential base files for the project. It also highlights the latest developments, including the loading of 3D models onto the map, the completion of the dashboard with data and graphs, and identifies pending tasks related to dynamic movements of 3D assets on the map based on the trip system and the implementation of login authentication logic for the Login page.

## Completed Tasks

### Main Project

1. **Updated README.md:** The README.md file has been created and updated with comprehensive information about the project, including its overview, features, technologies used, getting started guide, data sources, contribution guidelines, and contact information. The README file is now more informative and user-friendly.

2. **Base Files Added:** Essential base files required for the main project, including React application code, Blender 3D models, and necessary configuration files, have been added to the repository. This includes the following files and directories:

   - `src/`: Contains the React application source code.
   - `models/`: Includes Blender 3D models for visualization.
   - `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
   - `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
   - `LICENSE`: Provides project licensing information (MIT License).

3. **Live Map with Road Path Highlights:** Implemented a live map feature with road path highlights to provide users with a clear view of transportation routes within the coal mines.

4. **Socket Connection:** Successfully established a socket connection to enable real-time transport route data and time tracking. This feature enhances the visualization by providing dynamic updates.

5. **Mine Boundary Designs:** Completed the development of 3D mine boundary designs within the main project, enhancing the visual representation of mine boundaries.

6. **Loading 3D Models on Map:** Integrated the loading of 3D models onto the map, providing users with a realistic representation of transportation assets within the mine.

### Admin Dashboard

1. **Dashboard Completion:** The admin dashboard has been completed and now offers a range of features:
   - **Data Overview:** Provides an overview of transportation data.
   - **Graph Analysis:** Offers in-depth graph analysis tools for data visualization.
   - **Vehicle Health Status:** Monitors the health status of vehicles in real time.
   - **Task Pane:** Allows users to manage pending requests and tasks.
   - **Maintenance Reporting:** Provides a section for reporting maintenance issues.
   - **Data and Graphs:** The dashboard now displays data and graphs for enhanced data analysis.

## Pending Tasks

### Main Project

1. **Dynamic 3D Asset Movements:** Implement dynamic movements for 3D assets on the map based on the trip system, allowing users to track asset movements in real time.

### Admin Dashboard

1. **Login Authentication Logic:** Develop and implement login authentication logic for the Login page to enhance security and user access control.

## Challenges

During the update process, we faced some challenges, including:

- **Data Integration Complexity:** Integrating real-time sensor data and information is a complex task that requires careful planning and implementation.

- **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring smooth and efficient 3D visualization can be challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets.
