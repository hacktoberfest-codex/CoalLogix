# GitHub Repository Update Status Report

**Project Name:** 3D Coal Mine Transportation Visualization

**Date:** September 17, 2023 01:30:00 AM

## Overview

This status report provides an update on the progress of updating our GitHub repository for the "3D Coal Mine Transportation Visualization" project. The purpose of this update is to ensure that the repository contains up-to-date README files and essential base files for the project, and to highlight the addition of tasks, analytics, and reports functionality to the dashboard. Additionally, the server with socket connection on the backend side has been successfully implemented.

## Completed Tasks

### Main Project

1. **Updated README.md:** The README.md file has been created and updated with comprehensive information about the project, including its overview, features, technologies used, getting started guide, data sources, contribution guidelines, and contact information. The README file is now more informative and user-friendly.

2. **Base Files Added:** Essential base files required for the main project, including React application code, Blender 3D models, and necessary configuration files, have been added to the repository. This includes the following files and directories:

   - `src/`: Contains the React application source code.
   - `models/`: Includes Blender 3D models for visualization.
   - `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
   - `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
   - `LICENSE`: Provides project licensing information (MIT License).

3. **Basic Map Functionality:** Integrated basic map functionality into the main project using the `react-map-gl` library. Users can now view the map with the ability to zoom in when the spacebar or Enter key is pressed.

4. **Server Implementation:** The server backend has been successfully implemented with socket connection support, enabling real-time data communication and updates between the frontend and backend.

5. **Mine Boundary Designs:** Work has begun on developing 3D mine boundary designs within the main project to enhance the visual representation of mine boundaries.

### Admin Dashboard Branch

1. **Dashboard Base Files Added:** Developed an admin dashboard in the `dashboard` branch. Essential base files for the dashboard, including React components, Shadcn UI library integration, and initial dashboard layout, have been added.

2. **Shadcn UI Library Integration:** Integrated the Shadcn UI library with React for building the admin dashboard. This library provides a set of pre-designed components and styles for rapid development of user interfaces.

3. **Functionality Enhancement:** Added tasks, analytics, and reports functionality to the admin dashboard, allowing users to manage tasks, access analytics data, and generate reports.

## Next Steps

### Main Project

1. **Data Integration:** Continue working on integrating real-time sensor data from within the coal mines and information from transportation vehicles into the main project. This data will be processed and made available for visualization.

2. **Mine Boundary Designs:** Further develop 3D mine boundary designs within the main project to enhance the visual representation of mine boundaries.


### Admin Dashboard Branch

1. **Dashboard Development:** Continue developing the admin dashboard in the `dashboard` branch, refining tasks, analytics, and reports functionality.

2. **Testing and Validation:** Ensure the admin dashboard is being tested.

3. **Merging into Main:** Once the admin dashboard is ready, merge the `dashboard` branch into the main project for seamless integration.

## Challenges

During the update process, we faced some challenges, including:

- **Data Integration Complexity:** Integrating real-time sensor data and information is a complex task that requires careful planning and implementation.

- **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring smooth and efficient 3D visualization can be challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets.
